Explanation of the routines in the file
synch_pair_emissivities.f95

fsynchqmexact(eta,chi) is the function defined in 
the PPCF paper (KBA 2009) equation A1. It evaluates the J functions 
by interpolation in a table stored in the file "j1j2j3.table"

gsokolov(eta) is defined in KBA eq (15)

hsokolov(eta) is similar, but has a weighting ofo 1/\chi in the 
integrand:  
$h(\eta)=\int_0^{(\eta/2)^{1/3}} dy 3*fsynchqmexact(eta,y^3)/y$

fairy(x) is the standard classical synchrotron function in the Airy
integral approximation, as defined in KBA eq (10)

omegahat(eta) is the function used in trident pair production,
eq (17), which uses the table "pairprod.table"

tpair (chi) is the function used in magnetic pair production by a photon
BKA eq (19). It also uses "pairprod.table"

nmroutines.f contains the routines from Numerical Recipes that are needed
