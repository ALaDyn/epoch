This codebase conforms to a single, consistent coding style which is
outlined in the following text. New submissions will be rejected if they
do not conform to this style.

The most important rules are the following:

All code must conform to the Fortran 95 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1: 1997).

All Fortran keywords and intrinsics are uppercase, user-defined
function, subroutine and variable names are lowercase.
 - One exception to this rule is the MPI libraries. For this, both constants
   and routine names are uppercase.

All function and subroutine blocks are separated by three blank lines.
Within the rest of the code body there should never be more than one
consecutive blank line.

Indentation is two spaces. Continuation lines are indented by four spaces.
Comments should follow the same indentation as code.

All code lines must be 80 columns or less. This includes comments.

A comma is always followed by a space with the exception of array indexing.

The equals sign in assignments is always surrounded by whitespace.

Lines must not contain trailing whitespace.

Lines must not contain tab characters.

Use 'ENDIF' and 'ENDDO' instead of 'END IF' and 'END DO'.

Use F77-style binary operators instead of F90 ones. eg. use '.EQ.'
instead of '=='.

Variable names must not clash with Fortran keywords.

If a line is split on an operator, the operator should appear at the
beginning of the continuation line rather than at the end of the split line.

For all other matters of coding style, try to match the style used throughout
the rest of the code.
